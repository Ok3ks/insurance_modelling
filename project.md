To achieve this objective, it was further broken into the following 5 technical sub-objectives
    1. To perform in-depth exploratory data analysis of both datasets(tabular and graph)
    2. To engineer new predictive features from the available data
    3. To develop a supervised model to classify likelihood of insurance claims
    4. To create an API endpoint for the trained model and deploy it.
